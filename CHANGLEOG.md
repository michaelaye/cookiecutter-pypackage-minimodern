## [0.0.1] â€” 2019-12-26

[0.0.1]: https://github.com/Evpok/cookiecutter-pypackage-minimodern/compare/b3d223a08a1d1d6889b35c92d0211ee4b8506c3f...v0.0.1

First release since the fork from
[pypackage-minimal](https://github.com/kragniz/cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal).
It doesn't make a lot of sense to document everything but be my guest if you want to have a go at
it.
